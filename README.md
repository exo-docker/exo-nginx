# eXo Nginx Container

This repository contains a custom build of Nginx with additional modules, including support for ModSecurity, Google PageSpeed, and various other enhancements. This image is designed for use in environments requiring advanced HTTP and security functionalities.

## Usage

This image can be used similarly to the official [nginx image](https://hub.docker.com/_/nginx/), with additional features and modules. Configuration and management follow standard Nginx conventions.

### Example Usage

```bash
docker run --name exo-nginx -v $(pwd)/nginx.conf:/etc/nginx/nginx.conf:ro -p 80:80 exoplatform/nginx
```
